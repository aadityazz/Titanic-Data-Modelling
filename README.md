# Titanic-Data-Modelling

This is my first and only ML project.
Gave me a very good understanding of generating insights from data. How data can be used to unleash the unknown facts of human behovior.
Overall I believe its a very good project to start my ML journey. This gave me an opportunity to explore many algorithms that can help predict what is going to happen.
Implemented  Logistic regression, Random forest, XGboost and Catboost. I am in the process of understanding the mechanics of these algorithms.

Tried Logistic Regression and random forest. 
Precision of the model is 85.3%


Titanic Data Modelling is open source project given by Kaggle.com
